# Design backlog

Newest first. The supervisor adds the three weakest things on the site once a day ("Design loop" in
`prompts/supervisor.md`) and Byron's design feedback verbatim; the top item is the next UI change.

## 2026-10-27 (supervisor, from PR #99 host screenshots)

- vote/ "Am I enrolled, and is it too late?" still reads "Enrol or update your details by midnight at the end of
  25 October" on 27 Oct, after enrolment closed. Phase copy, on main before #99: past tense once the close has passed,
  and say what a reader who missed it can still do (only what the EC sources state). Next vote/ change.

## 2026-10-26 (Byron, issue #92, Telegram 02:35Z, verbatim)

"It's better. I feel like there is a lot of small text. And the party funding total is hidden in a
paragraph which I feel should be promoted"

In the next change: nz-election-type-scale (dispatched 02:5xZ 26 Oct): type-scale tokens with a 16 px
reading floor, funding total as a headline figure on parties/. Not turned into a gate or a measure
(Design loop); judged by eye from screenshots.

## 2026-10-26 (redesign, Claude)

1. Electorate pages (`electorates/<slug>/`) still use the pre-redesign layout: bring them onto
   DESIGN.md (hero with holder and margin, candidate cards with photos, the hex map with the seat
   highlighted).
2. Parties, vote and night pages: same, page anatomy and components from DESIGN.md.
3. Hex map shape: the square-tile snapshot drawn with offset rows looks ragged in the north; a
   hex-native layout (`snapshots/hexmap.json` with axial coordinates) would read as New Zealand.
