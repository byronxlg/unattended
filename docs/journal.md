# Journal

The complete record of the lab, kept so it can be read back at the end (Byron, 2026-10-16
22:58Z). Append-only, one dated entry per supervisor run, UTC; rules in `prompts/supervisor.md`
"Journal". The daily posts are the public digest of this. Entries before 2026-10-17 are a
backfill written by the fleet operator from `state/phase.md`, `state/changes.yaml`, the issues
and the posts; the supervisor should add anything those left out on its next runs.

## 2026-10-15 (day 0, backfill)

- Byron's brief (a Claude Code session, recorded as management D61): spend the idle Codex
  subscription for about twenty days building something of the model's choosing, Claude as
  supervisor, Codex for the token-heavy work, Anthropic's AI-native SDLC playbook with its
  indicators measured, a daily public blog, do not involve him.
- Loop live (`com.unattended.tick`, 600 s), blog live, first post, Byron told on Telegram.
- Fleet Audit chosen and built as the warm-up change (PRs #1 to #5, 11 reviewed attempts); day 1
  hit the Claude usage limit 21 ticks in a row, which became the cost guardrail.

## 2026-10-16 (days 1 and 2, backfill)

- Byron, issue #7 (07:57Z): the product is a web app with a UI about the 2026 NZ election,
  pulling a ton of information together. Research, intent, spec and plan followed; M1 closed
  15:49Z with PRs #9 to #14 live at byronxlg.com/unattended/nz-election/.
- Byron, issue #15: sprinkle UI work and marketing into the plan (design track, name and
  subdomain, launch kit, analytics). Design track started: design.md draft 2, design-system build
  dispatched 22:25Z.
- Byron, Telegram 21:55Z (relayed to issue #15 by the operator): the lab posts the earned
  channels itself from election@byronxlg.com; the operator made the address (pdw#563, #564).
- Incident 21:55Z to 22:35Z: Pages verify demanded unpublished daily families; hotfix PR #16;
  eval `evals/pages-verify-polls-only`. The live site never regressed.
- Codex weekly window at 47 percent after two days; the even-spread allowance became about ten
  points a day.

## 2026-10-16T23:08Z (operator relay, Telegram)

Byron, four messages, relayed verbatim as issue #18 by the fleet operator:

- 22:56Z: "For the election site. I agree that because we have time we should use it to verify
  things work over a day to day time frame. I think you should do some more research on what
  people want to see and make some pages targeting different audiences and tailor the ui to
  them."
- 22:57Z: "At this stage I think you need to bring me in the loop a little bit more often to
  test your judgements."
- 22:58Z: "Make sure you capture everything that happens in repo notes or something so we can
  look back at it at the end."
- 22:59Z: "Also check when the codex subscription actually runs out. We should push this
  project out to at least one week post election night."

Operator actions: this journal and the "Byron in the loop" and "Journal" sections of
`prompts/supervisor.md`; the lab's end date moved to at least 2026-11-14 in the prompt, README,
CLAUDE.md and about page. Codex: OpenAI's email of 2026-10-08 05:54Z says the ChatGPT Pro plan
will not renew and is available until the end of the billing period on 2026-11-07 (the cycle
anchor in the Codex auth token is 03:14Z, so the afternoon of election day NZ); Byron has been
asked on Telegram whether he will renew. The audience research and pages are the supervisor's
to plan: first judgement call to send him under the new rule.
